                    <p>Hi! Welcome to Resale Nation. My name is Zac and for fun and to make money I go to Garage Sales,
                        Thrift Stores, Estate Sales, and Flea Markets to buy items to flip on places like Ebay and
                        Facebook Market Place.
                        I like to buy anything thatâ€™s cool or can make me a nice profit. I have sold items from Louis
                        Vuitton shoes to vintage
                        mid century modern chairs. I have been reselling for 10 years, since I was 14.

                            to take a look at stuff you want to get rid
                            of when your trying to downsize or move. Please also check out my growing YouTube Channel
                            Resale Nation. I like to also record me finding
                            great deals on items to resell. I like to take my audience along with me to watch me source
                            items and negotiate at flea markets and garage sales.
                            I also like showing my audience to whole process from buying the item to shipping it. I also
                            like to educate my viewers on what items to look for at garage
                            sales and thrift stores that you can buy for cheap and resell for a nice return!
