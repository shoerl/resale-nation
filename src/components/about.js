                    <p>
                        Hi, My name is Zac and for fun and to make money I go to Garage Sales, Thrift Stores, Estate Sales,
                        and Flea Markets to buy items to flip on places like Ebay and Facebook Market Place. I like to buy anything
                        thatâ€™s cool or can make me a nice profit. I have sold items from Louis Vuitton shoes to vintage mid century modern chairs.
                        I have been reselling for 10 year since I was 14.

                            me to watch me source items and negotiate at flea markets and garage sales. I also like showing my audience to whole process from
                            buying the item to shipping it.  I also like to educate my viewers on what items to look for at garage sales and thrift stores that you
